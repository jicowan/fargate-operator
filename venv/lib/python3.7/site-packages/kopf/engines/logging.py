"""
A connection between object logger and background k8s-event poster.

Everything logged to the object logger (except for debug information)
is also posted as the k8s-event -- in the background: `kopf.engines.posting`.

This eliminates the need to log & post the same messages, which complicates
the operators' code, and can lead to information loss or mismatch
(e.g. when logging call is added, but posting is forgotten).
